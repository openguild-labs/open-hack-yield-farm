![image](./public/assets/OpenHack_Yield_Farming_Challenge.png)

The **OpenGuild Labs** makes the repository to introduce OpenHack workshop participants to Solidity and help the participants to get familiar with the language. This challenge involves creating a smart yield-farming contract where users can stake LP tokens and earn rewards. You'll learn about DeFi mechanics, reward distribution, and staking mechanisms in Solidity and deploy on PolkaVM. 🚀

## 🚀 Installing MetaMask and Deploying Smart Contracts on Asset-Hub Westend

At the time writing this challenge, Hardhat haven't support deployment on Westend network, we need to use [remix](https://remix.polkadot.io/) for smart contract deployment

### 🦊 Installing and Setting Up MetaMask

1. 💿 Install Metahttps://remix.polkadot.io/Mask
   - Visit the [MetaMask website](https://metamask.io)
   - Click "Download" and add the extension to your browser
   - Create a new wallet by following the setup wizard
   - 🔐 Save your seed phrase securely and never share it with anyone

2. ⚙️ Configure Asset-Hub Westend Network
   - Click the network dropdown at the top of MetaMask
   - Select "Add Network" > "Add Network Manually"
   - Enter the following details:
     - 🌐 Network Name: Asset-Hub Westend Testnet
     - 🔗 RPC URL: https://westend-asset-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io
     - 🔢 Chain ID: 420420421
     - 💰 Currency Symbol: WND
     - 🔍 Block Explorer URL: https://assethub-westend.subscan.io

### 🪙 Getting Test Tokens

1. 💧 You'll need some WND tokens to deploy contracts
   - Visit the [Westend faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/westend?parachain=1000)
   - Request test tokens for your MetaMask address
   - ⏳ Wait for the tokens to appear in your wallet

## 💻 Using Remix and Deploying a Contract

🎯 Access Remix

   - Go to https://remix.polkadot.io
   - Simply copy/paste your yeild.sol contract

🔨 Compile the Contract

   - Select the "Solidity Compiler" tab
   - Choose compiler version (e.g., 0.8.0)
   - Click "Compile"

📤 Deploy the Contract

   - Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab
   - Set the environment to "Injected Provider - MetaMask"
   - Ensure your MetaMask is connected to Asset-Hub Westend
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Confirm
